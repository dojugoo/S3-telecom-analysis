## Telecom Statistical Data Analysis

## Goal of the data analysis

You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

Data is split among 4 main separate data sets.
Users, Calls, Messages, Internet

The main goal is to eventually evaluate and perform hypothesis testing on the average revenue from users with the different calling plans.

In order to get to this point, the data has to be processed to calculate the revenue based from the individual users calling information, texts/messages sent, and data from internet used given the charges based on the calling and data plans. Because of the amount of the information provided, statistics on the user based on their calls, messages, and internet usage can be generated and described as well.

First, what needs to be done is to process the data. Analyze the dataset to see what needs to be cleaned up, parsed, and processed to make subsequent analysis easier. Individual calls, messages, data usage can be grouped by user, and revenue can be determined based on this data. From there, further steps to process the data based on the question we want to probe with the data can be determined.

## Conclusions

Comparisons between the difference plans month to month by call duration, messages sent, and data used.

<b>Call duration</b>
- Surf plan: average call duration is 6.75, with standard deviation of 0.11.
- Ultimate plan: average call duration is 6.64, with standard deviation of 0.16.

<b>Messages sent</b>
- Surf plan: average messages sent is 32.41, with standard deviation of 30.97.
- Ultimate plan: average messages sent is 38.47, with standard deviation of 32.82

<b>Data usage</b>
- Surf plan: data (GBs) used average is 16.0, with standard deviation of 6.09
- Ultimate plan: data (GBs) used average is 16.15, with standard deviation of 5.76

<b>Revenue</b>
- Surf plan: revenue/month average is 57.84, with standard deviation of 43.4
- Ultimate plan: revenue/month average is 71.82, with standard deviation of 7.4

Overall, general behavior of users in regard to data usage, number of calls and call duration, and messages sent appear to be identical when comparing between the different plans, Surf and Ultimate. Looking at the average values for call duration, messages sent, data used, the average is identical between the plans and within the standard deviation. This indicates that there is no behavioral differences of people's usage on the different plans.

There is more revenue per user with people on the Ultimate plan, despite using similar amounts of data. People in the Surf plan tend to overuse their limits more in the plan, which leads to them paying more over the base compared to people on the Ultimate plan.

Finally, there is no statistical significance that there is more revenue coming in from users in the NY-NJ region compared to the other regions.
